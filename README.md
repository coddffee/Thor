# `About`

```about
  This is my first SpringBoot project, it is not a complete project, but I see it as my precious
learning note. It's sorry to say that I do not recommend you follow this project, but you can 
read it as a developing manual if you are a SpringBoot new hand too, and in this project, you 
can learn the basic file structure, basic configurations and the basic annotations of SpringBoot
project.
